      Ingredients:

      • 1 cup sour cream (can substitute with Greek yogurt for a thicker texture)
      • 1 cucumber, grated and squeezed to remove excess water
      • 1 tablespoon lemon juice
      • 1 tablespoon olive oil
      • 1 teaspoon garlic, minced (or more if you like it garlicky)
      • 1 teaspoon dried or fresh dill (optional: substitute with mint)
      • ½ teaspoon salt
      • ¼ teaspoon black pepper

      Instructions:

      1. Prepare the Cucumber – Grate the cucumber and squeeze out as much water as possible using a paper towel
      or clean
      kitchen towel.

      2. Mix Ingredients – In a bowl, combine sour cream, grated cucumber, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, dill,
      salt, and
      pepper.

      Chill – Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to let the flavors blend.
